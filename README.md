# Solitude  

**Status:** Unreleased, under-development.

Introducing a new gem-based Jekyll theme. Currently there's quite a bit to set up and go. Read on..  
Solitude has been written using *minima* as foundation.

## Installation

*Note: Gem found at RubyGems.org currently, is only a placeholder. Refer [Theme Preview](#theme-preview) to preview theme in action.*  

Solitude uses assets shipped alongwith the gem. This functionality requires Jekyll 3.3 which you need to currently source from the master branch of Jekyll repo itself.  
Source Solitude from this repo, as well. :

```ruby
# Gemfile

gem "jekyll", :github => "jekyll/jekyll"
gem "solitude", :github => "ashmaroli/solitude"
  
```
Then run `bundle install` to install these two gems alongwith their dependencies.

## Usage

Solitude uses the standard directory structure for a Jekyll Site. In addition, it uses an experimental native layout for the site's landing page. `index.html` is now a plain `index.md` with its layout defined by `home.html`.

Add Solitude to your `_config.yml` :

```yaml
theme: solitude
```

### Customization

To customize this theme for your site, simply create the concerned directory, (its subdirectory, if present) and its file. Jekyll will use that to override styles shipped with the gem.

#### To change the logo:

If you logo file is named `logo.png`:
- simply create a directory `assets/` at the root of your site and another directory `img/` within it.
- then add your `logo.png` to `<your-site>/assets/img/`

If your logo file is anything else: 
- create `<your-site>/assets/img/`
- add `<your-logo.extension>` to `<your-site>/assets/img/`
- update `_config.yml` by changing `logo: logo.png` to `logo: <your-logo.extension>`
