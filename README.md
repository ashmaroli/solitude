# Solitude  

**Status:** Unreleased, under-development.

Introducing a new gem-based Jekyll theme. Currently there's quite a bit to set up and go.
Solitude has been written using *minima* as foundation.

## Installation

*Note: Gem found at RubyGems.org currently, is only a placeholder. Refer [Theme Preview](#theme-preview) to preview theme in action.*

## Usage

Solitude uses the standard directory structure for a Jekyll Site. In addition, it uses an experimental native layout for the site's landing page. `index.html` is now a plain `index.md` with its layout defined by `home.html`.

## Theme Preview

To test this theme, clone the repo locally, run `bundle exec rake preview` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using this theme and the contents of the `demo/` directory.
